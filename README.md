## üìã Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

*   Node.js (for JavaScript runtime dependencies)
*   Bun (for JavaScript package management and building)

---

## üíª Development Setup

Get EduForge running locally in just a few steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/PatRogala/eduforge.git
    cd eduforge
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    *   Ruby Gems:
        ```bash
        bundle install
        ```
    *   JavaScript Packages:
        ```bash
        bun install
        ```

3.  **Set up the database:**
    *   Ensure PostgreSQL is running.
    *   Create and migrate the database:
        ```bash
        bin/rails db:create db:migrate db:seed
        ```
        *(The `db:seed` command creates default user roles).*

4.  **Build CSS & JavaScript:**
    ```bash
    bun run build # Build JS assets
    bun run build:css # Build CSS assets
    ```
    *(Note: `bin/dev` usually handles this automatically, but manual build is good to know).*

5.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    bin/dev
    ```
    This will typically start the Rails server, CSS watcher, and JS builder using Foreman or a similar tool based on `Procfile.dev`.

6.  **Visit:** Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000`

---

## üê≥ Docker Development Setup

Prefer Docker? We've got you covered:

1.  **Build and start the containers:**
    ```bash
    docker compose up --build
    ```
    *(This might take a while on the first run).*

2.  **Set up the database (in *another* terminal window):**
    ```bash
    docker compose exec eduforge bin/rails db:setup
    ```
    *(`db:setup` runs `db:create`, `db:schema:load`, and `db:seed`).*

3.  **Visit:** Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000`

**Useful Docker Commands:**

*   Stop the application: `docker compose down`
*   View logs: `docker compose logs -f eduforge` (or `docker compose logs -f` for all services)
*   Run Rails console: `docker compose exec eduforge bin/rails console`
*   Run database console: `docker compose exec eduforge bin/rails dbconsole`
*   Run tests: `docker compose exec eduforge bin/rails spec`

---

## ‚úÖ Testing

Run the full RSpec test suite:

```bash
bin/rails spec
# Or within Docker:
# docker compose exec eduforge bin/rails spec
```

---

## üö¢ Deployment

This application is configured for streamlined deployment using [Kamal](https://kamal-deploy.org/):

1.  Configure your `config/deploy.yml` and `.env` files with your server details and secrets.
2.  Set up your server(s) using `kamal setup`.
3.  Deploy the application:
    ```bash
    bin/kamal deploy
    ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Configuration Details

### Production Logging with Lograge

EduForge utilizes [Lograge](https://github.com/roidrage/lograge) in production for cleaner, structured JSON logs, ideal for log aggregation systems (ELK, Datadog, Splunk, etc.).

*   **Enabled:** In `config/environments/production.rb`.
*   **Format:** JSON (`Lograge::Formatters::Json`).
*   **Custom Fields:** Includes `exception`, `exception_message`, `time`, `host`, `pid`.
*   **Output:** `log/lograge_production.log`.
*   **Original Rails Log:** Standard Rails log (`log/production.log`) is kept for detailed debugging (`config.lograge.keep_original_rails_log = true`).

### Default Database Timestamp Type (`timestamptz`)

To ensure consistent timezone handling across the application, all `:datetime` columns defined in migrations automatically use PostgreSQL's `timestamptz` (timestamp with time zone) data type. This is configured via an initializer (`config/initializers/postgres.rb`).
